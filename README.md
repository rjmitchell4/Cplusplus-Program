# Investment Calculator using C++ OOP

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

    For this project, we were required to create an object-oriented application for an imaginary company. The goal of the code is to allow for user input in which
    an initial investment, monthly deposits, percent interest, and number of years are to be entered, and a console displays the projected balance over time. It is
    a quick demonstration of the power of investment for those who were not so financially literate growing up, such as myself.
  
  What did you do particularly well?
    In this instance, I believe I did a decent job of keeping the int main() concise, setting up both setters/getters in the class constructor, and
    efficiently displaying an easy to read chart of accruence over time. I think I did a good job of consolidating what could have been multiple functions
    into one by passing a bool which determined which branch to follow. 
  
  Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
     While I mentioned that I was able to consolidate my code with a bool, I think that my code in general could be even more condensed. 
     I also believe that if I was more proficient with pointer variables, I would have been able to pass references more easily and make the code
     a little more efficient. However, the complexity of it is still something I am internalizing, and opted to use a global variable instead, which 
     ended up working out alright in this case.
   
   Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
      Definitely found difficulty in keeping track of which functions connected and passed amongst each other. This was aided with comments and renaming 
      functions to be more apparent in their purposes. I have also begun doing a better job of testing portions of code before continuing its development to 
      ensure the process is resolved of bugs as soon as quickly. I am also learning to reach out for help, and better phrase questions for research and aid.
    
   What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
      I think all aspects of this program offered transferrable skills to other programs. Simply developing proficiency in object oriented programming is such 
      a profound and important skill that will help carry me forward. My debugging skills that were tuned during this process will also aid me in my future 
      endeavors, and generally pre-planning what purpose functions will serve ahead of time on paper will help me achieve success.
      
   How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      I made sure to divide each aspect into very specific components within functions. I also kept each similar batch of methods close to each other for easy 
      navigation. I tried to make sure the flow of the code made sense, and also with it's very brief and concise main(), it will allow the code to be uprooted 
      and implemented in other projects if I so wish to do so. The straightforwardness of the program should allow for easy changes and quick maintenance, and is 
      a great building block for potential future financial projects.
